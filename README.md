Welcome to Citrus

Citrus is a test framework written in Java that is able to create
fully automated end-to-end use case tests for enterprise SOA
applications. Citrus simulates surrounding interface partners
supporting a huge set of different transports and protocols like
Http, JMS, TCP/IP, FTP, SOAP, XML and JSON.
