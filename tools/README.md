Citrus tools ![Logo][1]
==============

Maven plugin
---------

The Citrus Maven plugin offers creating of test cases as well as generation of test suites from XSD or WSDL files.

Maven Archetypes
---------

The Maven archetypes generate basic Citrus projects with default directory layout and sample configurations according to a use case scenario. This is the
best way to get a Citrus project started.

Development
---------
If you want to compile and build the citrus-tools locally you need to also have the latest SNAPSHOT version of Citrus core [repo][4] built on that machine. This is because the Maven
archetypes and site plugins reference the latest SNAPSHOT versions of Citrus. Just clone and build and install the Citrus core [repo][4] locally before doing so with the citrus-tools.
