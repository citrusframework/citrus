== Cucumber

Behavior driven development (BDD) is a very popular concept when it comes to find a common understanding of test scopes
test logic. The idea of defining and describing the software behavior as basis for all tests in prior to translating those
feature descriptions into executable tests is a very interesting approach because it includes the technical experts as well
as the domain experts.

With BDD the domain experts should be able to read and verify tests and the technical experts get a detailed description
of what should happen in the test.

The test scenario descriptions follow the Gherkin syntax with a *"Given-When-Then"* structure. The Gherkin language is
business readable and helps to explain business logic with help of concrete examples.

There are several frameworks in the Java community supporting BDD concepts. Citrus has dedicated support for the Cucumber
framework because Cucumber is well suited for extensions and plugins. So with the Citrus and Cucumber integration you can
write Gherkin syntax scenarios in order to run those as Citrus integration tests.

NOTE: The Cucumber components in Citrus are located in a separate Maven module. You need to include the module as a Maven
dependency to your project.

.Cucumber module dependency
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.citrusframework.citrus</groupId>
  <artifactId>citrus-cucumber</artifactId>
  <version>${citrus.version}</version>
</dependency>
----

Cucumber works with both JUnit and TestNG as unit testing framework. You can choose which framework to use with Cucumber.
So following from that we need a Maven dependency for the unit testing framework support:

.Cucumber JUnit support
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.cucumber</groupId>
  <artifactId>cucumber-junit</artifactId>
  <version>${cucumber.version}</version>
</dependency>
----

In order to enable Citrus Cucumber support we need to specify a special object factory in the environment. The most
comfortable way to specify a custom object factory is to add this property to the `cucumber.properties` in classpath.

.cucumber.properties
[source,properties]
----
cucumber.object-factory=org.citrusframework.citrus.cucumber.backend.CitrusObjectFactory
----

This special object factory takes care on creating all step definition instances. The object factory is able to inject
`@CitrusResource` annotated fields in step classes. We will see this later on in the examples. The usage of this special
object factory is mandatory in order to combine Citrus and Cucumber capabilities.

The *CitrusObjectFactory* will automatically initialize the Citrus world for us. This includes the default Citrus context
configuration that is automatically loaded within the object factory. So you can define and use Citrus components as usual
within your test.

After these preparation steps you are able to combine Citrus and Cucumber in your project.

TIP: In case you want to use Spring support in Citrus with a Spring application context you should use the following factory
implementation.

.cucumber.properties
[source,properties]
----
cucumber.object-factory=org.citrusframework.citrus.cucumber.backend.spring.CitrusSpringObjectFactory
----

[[cucumber-options]]
=== Cucumber options

Cucumber is able to run tests with JUnit. The basic test case is an empty test which uses the respective JUnit runner
implementation from cucumber.

.MyFeature.java
[source,java]
----
@RunWith(Cucumber.class)
@CucumberOptions(
  plugin = { "pretty", "org.citrusframework.citrus.cucumber.CitrusReporter" } )
public class MyFeatureIT {
}
----

The test case above uses the *Cucumber* JUnit test runner. In addition to that we give some options to the Cucumber execution.
In case you want to have the usual Citrus test results reported you can add the special Citrus reporter implementation
`org.citrusframework.citrus.cucumber.CitrusReporter`. This class is responsible for printing the Citrus test summary. This reporter
extends the default Cucumber reporter so the default Cucumber report summary is also printed to the console.

That completes the JUnit class configuration. Now we are able to add feature stories and step definitions to the package
of our test *MyFeatureIT* . Cucumber and Citrus will automatically pick up step definitions and glue code in that test
package. So lets write a feature story *echo.feature* right next to the *MyFeatureIT* test class.

.echo.feature
[source,gherkin]
----
Feature: Echo service

  Scenario: Say hello
    Given My name is Citrus
    When I say hello to the service
    Then the service should return: "Hello, my name is Citrus!"

  Scenario: Say goodbye
    Given My name is Citrus
    When I say goodbye to the service
    Then the service should return: "Goodbye from Citrus!"
----

As you can see this story defines two scenarios with the Gherkin *Given-When-Then* syntax. Now we need to add step definitions
that glue the story description to Citrus test actions. Lets do this in a new class *EchoSteps* .

.EchoSteps.java
[source,java]
----
public class EchoSteps {

    @CitrusResource
    private TestCaseRunner runner;

    @Given("^My name is (.*)$")
    public void my_name_is(String name) {
        runner.variable("username", name);
    }

    @When("^I say hello.*$")
    public void say_hello() {
        runner.when(
                send("echoEndpoint")
                    .message()
                    .type(MessageType.PLAINTEXT)
                    .body("Hello, my name is ${username}!"));
    }

    @When("^I say goodbye.*$")
    public void say_goodbye() {
        runner.when(
                send("echoEndpoint")
                    .message()
                    .type(MessageType.PLAINTEXT)
                    .body("Goodbye from ${username}!"));
    }

    @Then("^the service should return: \"([^\"]*)\"$")
    public void verify_return(final String body) {
        runner.then(
                receive("echoEndpoint")
                    .message()
                    .type(MessageType.PLAINTEXT)
                    .body("You just said: " + body));
    }

}
----

The step definition class is a normal POJO that uses a some annotations such as `@CitrusResource` annotated `TestCaseRunner`.
The Citrus backend injects the test runner instance at runtime.

The step definition contains normal @Given, @When or @Then annotated methods that match the scenario descriptions in our
feature file. Cucumber will automatically find matching methods and execute them. The methods add test actions to the test runner
as we used to do in normal Java DSL tests.

That is a first combination of Citrus and Cucumber BDD. The feature file gets translated into step implementations that
use Citrus test action runner Java API to run integration tests with behavior driven development.

[[cucumber-xml-steps]]
=== Cucumber XML steps

The previous section handled glue code in Java in in form of step definitions accessing the Java test runner fluent API.
This chapter deals with the same concept with just XML configuration.

Citrus provides a separate configuration namespace and schema definition for Cucumber related step definitions. Include
this namespace into your Spring configuration in order to use the Citrus Cucumber configuration elements.

.Spring bean configuration schema
[source,xml]
----
<spring:beans xmlns:spring="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
     xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
     xmlns="http://www.citrusframework.org/schema/cucumber/testcase"
     xsi:schemaLocation="
     http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans
     http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd
     http://www.citrusframework.org/schema/cucumber/testcase
     http://www.citrusframework.org/schema/cucumber/testcase/citrus-cucumber-testcase.xsd">

    [...]

</spring:beans>
----

The JUnit Cucumber feature class itself does not change. We still use the Cucumber JUnit runner implementation with some
options specific to Citrus:

.MyFeatureIT.java
[source,java]
----
@RunWith(Cucumber.class)
@CucumberOptions(
    plugin = { "pretty", "org.citrusframework.citrus.cucumber.CitrusReporter" } )
public class MyFeatureIT {
}
----

The feature file with its Gherkin scenarios does also not change:

.echo.feature
[source,gherkin]
----
Feature: Echo service

  Scenario: Say hello
    Given My name is Citrus
    When I say hello to the service
    Then the service should return: "Hello, my name is Citrus!"

  Scenario: Say goodbye
    Given My name is Citrus
    When I say goodbye to the service
    Then the service should return: "Goodbye from Citrus!"
----

In the feature package *my.company.features* we add a new XML file `EchoSteps.xml` that holds the new XML step definitions:

.EchoSteps.xml
[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<spring:beans xmlns:citrus="http://www.citrusframework.org/schema/testcase"
      xmlns:spring="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
      xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
      xmlns="http://www.citrusframework.org/schema/cucumber/testcase"
      xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans
                          http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd
                          http://www.citrusframework.org/schema/cucumber/testcase
                          http://www.citrusframework.org/schema/cucumber/testcase/citrus-cucumber-testcase.xsd">

  <step given="^My name is (.*)$" parameter-names="username">
    <citrus:create-variables>
      <citrus:variable name="username" value="${username}"/>
    </citrus:create-variables>
  </step>

  <step when="^I say hello.*$">
    <citrus:send endpoint="echoEndpoint">
      <citrus:message type="plaintext">
        <citrus:data>Hello, my name is ${username}!</citrus:data>
      </citrus:message>
    </citrus:send>
  </step>

  <step when="^I say goodbye.*$">
    <citrus:send endpoint="echoEndpoint">
      <citrus:message type="plaintext">
        <citrus:data>Goodbye from ${username}!</citrus:data>
      </citrus:message>
    </citrus:send>
  </step>

  <step then="^the service should return: &quot;([^&quot;]*)&quot;$" parameter-names="body">
    <citrus:receive endpoint="echoEndpoint">
      <citrus:message type="plaintext">
        <citrus:data>You just said: ${body}</citrus:data>
      </citrus:message>
    </citrus:receive>
  </step>

</spring:beans>
----

The above step definition uses pure XML actions. Citrus will automatically read the step definition and add those to the
Cucumber runtime. Following from that the step definitions are executed when matching a statement in the feature story.

The XML step files follow a naming convention. Citrus will look for all files located in the feature package with name
pattern `\\**/**.Steps.xml` and load those definitions when Cucumber starts up.

The XML steps are able to receive parameters from the Gherkin regexp matcher. The parameters are passed to the step as
test variable. The parameter names get declared in the optional attribute `parameter-names`. In the step definitions you
can use the parameter names as test variables.

NOTE: The test variables are visible in all upcoming steps, too. This is because the test variables are global by default.
If you need to set local state for a step definition you can use another attribute `global-context` and set it to `false`
in the step definition. This way all test variables and parameters are only visible in the step definition. Other steps
will not see the test variables.

NOTE: Another notable thing is the XML escaping of reserved characters in the pattern definition. You can see that in the
last step where the *then* attribute is escaping quotation characters.

.Escape reserved characters
[source,xml]
----
<step then="^the service should return: &quot;([^&quot;]*)&quot;$" parameter-names="body">
...
</step>
----

We have to do this because otherwise the quotation characters will interfere with the XML syntax in the attribute.

This completes the description of how to add XML step definitions to the cucumber BDD tests.

[[cucumber-spring]]
=== Cucumber Spring support

Cucumber provides support for Spring dependency injection in step definition classes. The Cucumber Spring capabilities
are included in a separate module. So we first of all we have to add this dependency to our project:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.cucumber</groupId>
  <artifactId>cucumber-spring</artifactId>
  <version>${cucumber.version}</version>
</dependency>
----

The Citrus Cucumber extension has to handle things different when Cucumber Spring support is enabled. Therefore we use
another object factory implementation that also support Cucumber Spring features. Change the object factory property in
*cucumber.properties* to the following:

.cucumber.properties
[source,properties]
----
cucumber.object-factory=org.citrusframework.citrus.cucumber.backend.spring.CitrusSpringObjectFactory
----

Now we are ready to add *@Autowired* Spring bean dependency injection to step definition classes:

.EchoSteps.java
[source,java]
----
@ContextConfiguration(classes = CitrusSpringConfig.class)
public class EchoSteps {
    @Autowired
    private Endpoint echoEndpoint;

    @CitrusResource
    protected TestDesigner designer;

    @Given("^My name is (.*)$")
    public void my_name_is(String name) {
        designer.variable("username", name);
    }

    @When("^I say hello.*$")
    public void say_hello() {
        designer.send(echoEndpoint)
            .messageType(MessageType.PLAINTEXT)
            .payload("Hello, my name is ${username}!");
    }

    @When("^I say goodbye.*$")
    public void say_goodbye() {
        designer.send(echoEndpoint)
            .messageType(MessageType.PLAINTEXT)
            .payload("Goodbye from ${username}!");
    }

    @Then("^the service should return: \"([^\"]*)\"$")
    public void verify_return(final String body) {
        designer.receive(echoEndpoint)
            .messageType(MessageType.PLAINTEXT)
            .payload("You just said: " + body);
    }
}
----

As you can see we used Spring autowiring mechanism for the *echoEndpoint* field in the step definition. Also be sure to
define the *@ContextConfiguration* annotation on the step definition. The Cucumber Spring support loads the Spring application
context and takes care on dependency injection. We use the Citrus *CitrusSpringConfig* Java configuration because this is
the main entrance for Citrus test cases. You can add custom beans and further Spring related configuration to this Spring
application context. If you want to add more beans for autowiring do so in the Citrus Spring configuration. Usually this
is the default *citrus-context.xml* which is automatically loaded.

Of course, you can also use a custom Java Spring configuration class here. Please be sure to always import the Citrus
Spring Java configuration classes, too.

As usual, we are able to use *@CitrusResource* annotated *TestCaseRunner* fields for building the Citrus integration test
logic. With this extension you can use the full Spring testing power in your tests in particular dependency injection and
also transaction management for data persistence tests.

[[yaks-step-definitions]]
=== YAKS step definitions

https://github.com/citrusframework/yaks[YAKS] is a side project of Citrus and provides some predefined steps for typical
integration test scenarios that you can use out-of-the-box.

You can basically define send/receive operations and many other predefined steps to handle Citrus test
actions. As these steps are predefined in YAKS you just need to use them in your feature stories. The step definitions with
glue to test actions is handled automatically in YAKS.

If you want to enable predefined steps support in your test you need to include the YAKS module as a Maven dependency.

.YAKS module dependency
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.citrusframework.yaks</groupId>
  <artifactId>yaks-standard</artifactId>
  <version>${yaks.version}</version>
  <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
----

After that you need to include the glue code package in your test class like this:

.Include YAKS steps
[source,java]
----
@RunWith(Cucumber.class)
@CucumberOptions(
    extraGlue = { "org.citrusframework.yaks.standard" },
    plugin = { "pretty", "org.citrusframework.citrus.cucumber.CitrusReporter" } )
public class MyFeatureIT {

}
----

Instead of writing the glue code on our own in step definition classes we include the glue package `org.citrusframework.yaks.standard`
as extra glue. This automatically loads all YAKS step definitions in this module. Once you have done this you can use predefined
steps without having to write any glue code in Java.

The YAKS framework provides the following modules with predefined steps:

.YAKS modules
|===
|Module |Description

| yaks-standard
| Standard steps such as test variables, sleep/delay, log/print, ...

| yaks-http
| Http steps for client and server side communication

| yaks-openapi
| Load Open API specifications and invoke/verify operations with generated test data

| yaks-kubernetes
| Manage Kubernetes resources (e.g. pods, deployments, custom resources)

| yaks-knative
| Steps to connect with Knative eventing and messaging

| yaks-jms
| Send/receive steps via JMS queues/topics

| yaks-kafka
| Steps to publish/subscribe on Kafka messaging

| yaks-jdbc
| Steps to connect to relational databases

| yaks-camel
| Steps to access Apache Camel components and Camel routes

| yaks-camel-k
| Manage Camel-K resources on Kubernetes

| yaks-selenium
| Run UI tests with Selenium using Selenium grid or standalone containers

| yaks-groovy
| Leverage Groovy scripts as Citrus endpoint and component configuration
|===

Once again it should be said that the step definitions included in this modules can be used out-of-the-box. You can start
to write feature stories in Gherkin syntax that trigger the predefined steps.
