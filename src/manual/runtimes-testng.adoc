== TestNG

https://testng.org[TestNG] stands for next generation testing and has had a great influence in adding Java annotations to the unit test community.
Citrus is able to define tests as executable TestNG Java classes.

NOTE: The TestNG support is shipped in a separate Maven module. You need to include the module as a dependency in your
project.

.TestNG module dependency
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.citrusframework</groupId>
  <artifactId>citrus-testng</artifactId>
  <version>${citrus.version}</version>
</dependency>

[[testng-tests]]
=== TestNG tests

See the following sample showing how to write a Citrus test on top of TestNG:

.TestNG Citrus test
[source,java]
----
package org.citrusframework.samples;

import org.testng.annotations.Test;
import org.citrusframework.annotations.CitrusTest;
import org.citrusframework.testng.TestNGCitrusSupport;

@Test
public class Simple_IT extends TestNGCitrusSupport {

    @CitrusTest(name = "Simple_IT")
    public void simpleTest() {
        description("First example showing the basic Java DSL!");

        given(
            variable("user", "Citrus")
        );

        then(
            echo().message("Hello ${user}!"
        ));
    }
}
----

If you are familiar with TestNG you will see that the Java class is a normal TestNG test class using the usual
`@Test` annotation. For convenience reasons you can extend a basic Citrus TestNG base class `TestNGCitrusSupport` which
enables the Citrus test execution as well as the Java DSL features for us.

NOTE: You can also combine Citrus with the Spring framework and its dependency injection and IoC capabilities. In order to
enable Spring support in Citrus add the `citrus-spring` module to your project and extend `TestNGCitrusSpringSupport` as a
base class. With the Spring support in Citrus the test is able to use `@Autowired` annotations for injecting Spring beans into the
test class and you can define the Spring application context with `@Configuration` annotations for instance.

In addition, the test methods use the *@CitrusTest* annotation which allows setting properties such as test names and packages.

The Citrus test logic goes directly as the method body with using the Citrus Java domain specific language features. As you
can see the Java DSL is able to follow BDD (Behavior Drive Design) principles with Given-When-Then syntax. As an alternative
to that you can just use `run()` for all test actions.

.Pure test action DSL
[source,java]
----
@CitrusTest(name = "Simple_IT")
public void simpleTest() {
    description("First example showing the basic Java DSL!");

    run(variable("user", "Citrus"));

    run(
        echo().message("Hello ${user}!"
    ));
}
----

The great news is that you can still use the awesome TestNG features in with the Citrus test class (e.g. parallel test
execution, test groups, setup and tear down operations and so on). Just to give an example we can simply add a test group
to our test like this:

.Set test groups
[source,java]
----
@Test(groups = {"long-running"})
public void longRunningTest() {
    ...
}
----

For more information on TestNG please visit the https://testng.org[official TestNG website], where you find a complete
reference documentation. The following sections deal with a subset of these TestNG features in particular.

[[testng-dataproviders]]
=== Use TestNG data providers

TestNG as a framework comes with lots of great features such as data providers. Data providers execute a test case several
times with different test data. Each test execution works with a specific parameter value. You can use data provider
parameter values as test variables in Citrus. See the next listing on how to use TestNG data providers in Citrus:

.TestNG Citrus data provider test
[source,java]
----
public class DataProviderIT extends TestNGCitrusSupport {

    @CitrusTest
    @CitrusParameters( {"message", "delay"} )
    @Test(dataProvider = "messageDataProvider")
    public void dataProvider(String message, Long sleep) {
        run(echo(message));
        run(sleep().milliseconds(sleep));

        run(echo("${message}"));
        run(echo("${delay}"));
    }

    @DataProvider
    public Object[][] messageDataProvider() {
        return new Object[][] {
                { "Hello World!", 300L },
                { "Citrus rocks!", 1000L },
                { "Hi from Citrus!", 500L },
        };
    }
}
----

Above test case method is annotated with TestNG data provider called *messageDataProvider* . In the same class you can write
the data provider that returns a list of parameter values. TestNG will execute the test case several times according to the
provided parameter list. Each execution is shipped with the respective parameter value.

According to the *@CitrusParameter* annotation the test will have test variables called `message` and `delay`.

[[testng-parallel]]
=== Run tests in parallel

Integration tests tend to be more time-consuming compared to pure unit tests when it comes to execute tests. This is because
integration tests often need to initialize test infrastructure (e.g. test servers, database connections). Running tests
in parallel can reduce the overall test suite time a lot.

When running tests in parallel you need to make sure each test operates on its own set of resources. Tests must not share
components such as the Citrus Java DSL test action runner or the test context.

You should be using the resource injection to make sure each test operates on its own resources.

.Resource injection
[source,java]
----
public class ResourceInjection_IT extends TestNGCitrusSupport {

    @Test
    @CitrusTest
    public void injectResources(@Optional @CitrusResource TestCaseRunner runner,
                                @Optional @CitrusResource TestContext context) {

        runner.given(
            createVariable("random", "citrus:randomNumber(10)")
        );

        runner.run(
            echo("The random number is: ${random}")
        );
    }
}
----

First of all the method parameters must be annotated with `@Optional` because the values are not injected by TestNG itself
but by the Citrus base test class. Finally, the parameter requires the `@CitrusResource` annotations in order to mark the
parameter for Citrus resource injection.

Now each method uses its own resource instances which makes sure that parallel test execution can take place without having
the risk of side effects on other tests running at the same time. Of course, you also need to make sure that the message
exchange in your tests is ready to be performed in parallel (e.g. use message selectors).
