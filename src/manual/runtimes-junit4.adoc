[[runtime-junit4]]
== JUnit4

JUnit4 is still very popular and widely supported by many tools even though there is a new major version with JUnit5 already
available. In general Citrus supports both JUnit4 and JUnit5 as test execution framework.

NOTE: The JUnit4 support is shipped in a separate Maven module. You need to include the module as a dependency in your
project.

.JUnit4 module dependency
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.citrusframework</groupId>
  <artifactId>citrus-junit</artifactId>
  <version>${citrus.version}</version>
</dependency>

[[junit4-tests]]
=== JUnit4 tests

See the following sample test class that uses JUnit4.

.JUnit4 Citrus test
[source,java]
----
package org.citrusframework.samples;

import org.testng.annotations.Test;
import org.citrusframework.annotations.CitrusTest;
import org.citrusframework.junit.JUnit4CitrusSupport;

@Test
public class Simple_IT extends JUnit4CitrusSupport {

    @CitrusTest(name = "Simple_IT")
    public void simpleTest() {
        description("First example showing the basic Java DSL!");

        given(
            variable("user", "Citrus")
        );

        then(
            echo().message("Hello ${user}!"
        ));
    }
}
----

The simple test class above uses the normal `@Test` annotation and extends the base class `JUnit4CitrusSupport`. This is
the most convenient way to access the Citrus Java DSL capabilities. As an alternative you may switch to using the
`CitrusJUnit4Runner` in your test class.

The fine thing here is that we are still able to use all JUnit features such as before/after hooks or ignoring tests.

After the test run the result is reported exactly like a usual JUnit unit test would do. This also means that
you can execute this Citrus JUnit class like every other JUnit test, especially out of any Java IDE, with Maven, with Gradle and so on.

NOTE: You can also combine Citrus with the Spring framework and its dependency injection and IoC capabilities. In order to
enable Spring support in Citrus add the `citrus-spring` module to your project and extend `JUnit4CitrusSpringSupport` as a
base class. With the Spring support in Citrus the test is able to use `@Autowired` annotations for injecting Spring beans into the
test class and you can define the Spring application context with `@Configuration` annotations for instance.

[[junit4-parallel]]
=== Run tests in parallel

Integration tests tend to be more time-consuming compared to pure unit tests when it comes to execute tests. This is because
integration tests often need to initialize test infrastructure (e.g. test servers, database connections). Running tests
in parallel can reduce the overall test suite time a lot.

When running tests in parallel you need to make sure each test operates on its own set of resources. Tests must not share
components such as the Citrus Java DSL test action runner or the test context.

You should be using the resource injection to make sure each test operates on its own resources.

.Resource injection
[source,java]
----
public class ResourceInjection_IT extends JUnit4CitrusSupport {

    @Test
    @CitrusTest
    public void injectResources(@CitrusResource TestCaseRunner runner,
                                @CitrusResource TestContext context) {

        runner.given(
            createVariable("random", "citrus:randomNumber(10)")
        );

        runner.run(
            echo("The random number is: ${random}")
        );
    }
}
----

The method parameters require the `@CitrusResource` annotations in order to mark the parameter for Citrus resource injection.

Now each method uses its own resource instances which makes sure that parallel test execution can take place without having
the risk of side effects on other tests running at the same time. Of course, you also need to make sure that the message
exchange in your tests is ready to be performed in parallel (e.g. use message selectors).
