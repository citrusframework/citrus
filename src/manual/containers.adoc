= Containers

Similar to templates a container element holds one to many test actions. In contrast to the template the container appears directly inside the test case action chain, meaning that the container is not referenced by more than one test case.

Containers execute the embedded test actions in specific logic. This can be an execution in iteration for instance. Combine different containers with each other and you will be able to generate very powerful hierarchical structures in order to create a complex execution logic. In the following sections some predefined containers are described.
