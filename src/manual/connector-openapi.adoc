[[openapi]]
== OpenAPI support

https://www.openapis.org/[OpenAPI] is a popular specification language to describe HTTP APIs and its exposure to clients.
Citrus is able to leverage the specification to auto generate client and server request/response message data.
The generated message data follows the rules of a given operation in the specification.
In particular, the message body is generated from the given Json schema rules in that specification.
This way users may do contract-driven testing where the client and the server ensure the conformity with the contract to obey to the same specification rules.

NOTE: The OpenAPI support in Citrus get enabled by adding a separate Maven module as dependency to your project

[[openapi-specification]]
=== OpenAPI specification

The OpenAPI test actions in Citrus uses a specification which usually is a json or yaml document shared between the components.

Sometimes the specification gets exposed by a server application via HTTP endpoint.
You can directly load the specification from the HTTP URL.
Or you may just point the OpenAPI components to a local specification file.

Citrus supports OpenAPI on both client and server components so the next sections will describe the usage for each of those.

[[openapi-client]]
=== OpenAPI client

On the client side Citrus uses the OpenAPI specification to generate a proper HTTP request that is sent to the server.
The user just gives a valid operationId from the specification every thing else is automatically generated.
The Citrus client message will use the proper request path (e.g. `/petstore/v3/pet`) and Content-Type (e.g. `applicaiton/json`) according to the specification rules.

Of course, you can also validate the HTTP response message with auto generated validation.
The user just gives the expected HTTP status code that is also described in the specification (e.g. 200 OK).
The response data used as expected message content is then also generated from the specification.

As an example the following OpenAPI specification defines the operation `getPetById`.

.petstore-v3.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
openapi: 3.0.2
info:
  title: Petstore
  version: 1.0.1
servers:
  - url: 'http://localhost/petstore/v3/'
paths:
  '/pet/{petId}':
    get:
      operationId: getPetById
      parameters:
        - name: petId
          description: ID of pet to return
          schema:
            format: int64
            type: integer
          in: path
          required: true
      responses:
        '200':
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                $ref: '#/components/schemas/Pet'
        '404':
          description: Pet not found
      summary: Find pet by ID
      description: Returns a single pet
# ...
----

The operation defines the HTTP GET request on `/pet/{petId}` and the response `200` OK that delivers the `#/components/schemas/Pet` Json object to the calling client as a response.

The Json schema for the pet defines all properties on the object.

.Pet Json schema
[source,yaml]
----
Pet:
  required:
    - category
    - name
    - status
  type: object
  properties:
    id:
      format: int64
      type: integer
    category:
      $ref: '#/components/schemas/Category'
    name:
      type: string
      example: doggie
    photoUrls:
      type: array
      items:
        type: string
    tags:
      type: array
      items:
        $ref: '#/components/schemas/Tag'
    status:
      description: pet status in the store
      enum:
        - available
        - pending
        - sold
      type: string
# ...

In a testcase Citrus is able to leverage this information in order to send a proper request and validate the response based on the OpenAPI specification.

----

In this very first example The client uses the OpenAPI specification to generate a proper GET HTTP request for the `getPetById` operation.
The request is sent to the server using the request URL path `/petstore/v3/pet/${petId}` as declared in the OpenAPI specification.

The resulting HTTP response from the server is verified on the client by giving the operationId and the expected status `200`.
The OpenAPI client generates the expected control message from the given Json schema in the OpenAPI specification.

The generated control message contains validation matchers and expressions as follows.

.Generated control message body
[source,json]
----
{
  "id": "@isNumber()@",
  "name": "@notEmpty()@",
  "category": {
    "id": "@isNumber()@",
    "name": "@notEmpty()@"
  },
  "photoUrls": "@notEmpty()@",
  "tags":  "@ignore@",
  "status": "@matches(sold|pending|available)@"
}
----

This control message meets the rules defined by the OpenAPI Json schema specification for the pet object.
For instance the enum field `status` is validated with a matching expression.
In case the OpenAPI specification changes the generated control message will change accordingly.

This completes the client side OpenAPI support.
Now let's have a closer look at the server side OpenAPI support in the next section.

[[openapi-server]]
=== OpenAPI server

On the server side Citrus is able to verify incoming requests based on the OpenAPI specification.
The expected request message content as well as the expected resource URL path and the Content-Type are automatically validated.

.Java
[source,java,indent=0,role="primary"]
----
private final HttpServer httpServer = new HttpServerBuilder()
            .port(port)
            .timeout(5000L)
            .autoStart(true)
            .defaultStatus(HttpStatus.NO_CONTENT)
            .build();

private final OpenApiSpecification petstoreSpec = OpenApiSpecification.from(
            Resources.create("classpath:org/citrusframework/openapi/petstore/petstore-v3.json"));

@CitrusTest
public void openApiClientTest() {
    when(openapi(petstoreSpec)
                .server(httpServer)
                .receive("addPet"));

    then(openapi(petstoreSpec)
                .server(httpServer)
                .send("addPet", HttpStatus.CREATED));
}

----

The example above uses the `addPet` operation defined in the OpenAPI specification.
The operation expects a HTTP POST request with a pet object as message payload.
The OpenAPI server generates an expected Json message body according to the specification.
This ensures that the incoming client request meets the Json schema rules for the pet object.
Also, the server will verify the HTTP request method, the Content-Type header as well as the used resource path `/petstore/v3/pet`.

The given HTTP status code defines the response that should be sent by the server.
The server will generate a proper response according to the OpenAPI specification.
This also includes a potential response message body (e.g. pet object).
