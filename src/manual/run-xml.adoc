[[run-xml-tests]]
= XML tests

As an alternative to using the Citrus Java DSL users can use pure XML as a test definition file. The XML file holds all
test actions and tells Citrus what should happen in the test case. Citrus is able to load the XML test and run it as a normal
unit test using one of the provided runtimes (link:#runtime-junit4[JUnit4], link:#runtime-junit5[JUnit5] or link:#runtime-testng[TestNG]).

The XML tests are for those of you that do not want to code a test in Java.

The XML test case definition in Citrus uses two files that are connected via naming conventions.

.XML test case files
[source]
----
src/test/java/com/consol/citrus/MyFirstCitrus_IT.java
src/test/resources/com/consol/citrus/MyFirstCitrus_IT.xml
----

The files above represent a test called `MyFirstCitrus_IT`. The `.java` file defines the runtime that should be used to execute
the test (e.g. JUnit or TestNG). This Java file does not have any test logic and is not likely to be changed. In fact, you can generate
the Java file from Citrus (e.g. Maven plugin).

.Generate test files via Maven plugin

The command above creates the two test files (`.java` and `.xml`) using an interactive mode. The user provides the test case information
such as test name, package, runtime and so on.

    public void myFirstCitrus_IT() {
    }
}
----

The generated Java class has an empty method body and is not likely to be changed. This is because the Java class is only
there for loading the XML part and executing the test case. This means you can just look at the XML test part and add custom
test logic to the generated XML file.

The default naming convention requires the XML file with the test name in the same package as the generated Java class. This makes sure
that the Java class is able to find and load the XML file when running the test.

[[xml-test-annotation]]
== @CitrusTestSource annotation

Each XML test in Citrus defines the `@CitrusTestSource` annotation in the Java class. This annotation makes Citrus search for the
XML file that represents the Citrus test within your classpath.

In the basic example above this means that Citrus searches for a XML test file in *com/consol/citrus/MyFirstCitrus_IT.xml* .

You can customize this path and tell Citrus to search for another XML file by using the `@CitrusTestSource` annotation properties.

Following annotation properties are available:

[horizontal]
type:: Type of the test source to load (spring, groovy, xml, ...)
name:: List of test case names to execute. Names also define XML file names to look for (*.xml* file extension is not needed here).
packageName:: Custom package location for the XML files to load
packageScan:: List of packages that are automatically scanned for XML test files to execute. For each XML file found separate
test is executed. Note that this performs a Java Classpath package scan so all XML files in package are assumed to be valid Citrus
XML test cases. In order to minimize the amount of accidentally loaded XML files the scan will only load XML files with `\\**/*Test.xml` and `**/*IT.xml`
file name pattern.

.Customize XML file name and package
[source,java]
----
public class Sample_IT extends TestNGCitrusSpringSupport {

    @Test
    @CitrusTestSource(type = "spring", name = "CustomName_IT", packageName = "com.other.test.package")
    public void customXmlTest() {}
}
----

The annotation above loads a different XML test file named `CustomName_IT` in package `com.other.test.package`.

You can also load multiple XML files and run each of them.

.Load multiple XML files
[source,java]
----
public class Sample_IT extends TestNGCitrusSpringSupport {

    @Test
    @CitrusTestSource(type = "spring", name = { "Test_1", "Test_2" })
    public void multipleTests() {}
}
----

This tells Citrus to search for the files `Test_1.xml` and `Test_2.xml`. Citrus loads the files and runs each of them as
a separate test. You can also load all test in a package with a `packageScan`.

.Load multiple XML files
[source,java]
----
public class Sample_IT extends TestNGCitrusSpringSupport {

    @Test
    @CitrusTestSource(type = "spring", packageScan =  { "com.some.test.package", "com.other.test.package" })
    public void packageScanTest() {}
}
----

This loads all XML files in the given packages and executes each of them as a separate test.

You can also mix the various `@CitrusTestSource` annotations in a single Java class. The class can have several methods with
different annotations. Each annotated method represents one or more Citrus XML test cases.

.@CitrusTestSource annotations
[source,java]
----
public class SampleIT extends TestNGCitrusSpringSupport {

    @Test
    @CitrusTestSource(type = "spring", name = "SampleIT")
    public void sampleTest() {}

    @Test
    @CitrusTestSource(type = "spring", name = { "Test_1", "Test_2" })
    public void multipleTests() {}

    @Test
    @CitrusTestSource(type = "spring", name = "CustomName_IT", packageName = "com.other.test.package")
    public void customXmlTest() {}

    @Test
    @CitrusTestSource(type = "spring", packageScan =  { "com.some.test.package", "com.other.test.package" })
    public void packageScanTest() {}
}
----

You are free to combine these test annotations as you like in your class. Each XML test loaded as part of the class will
be reported separately as a unit test. So the test reports will have the exact number of tests executed with proper success and
failed stats. You can use the reports as normal unit test reports, for instance in a continuous build.

NOTE: When test execution takes place each test method annotation is evaluated in sequence. XML test cases that match several
times, for instance by explicit name reference and a package scan will be executed several times respectively.

TIP: The best thing about using the *@CitrusTestSource* annotation is that you can continue to use the test framework capabilities
(e.g. test groups, invocation count, thread pools, data providers, and so on).

All XML test definitions use a custom XML schema that aims to reach the convenience of a domain specific language (DSL).
The next sample shows the basic structure of an XML test definition.

.XML DSL
[source,xml]
----
<spring:beans
    xmlns="http://www.citrusframework.org/schema/testcase"
    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
    xmlns:spring="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
    xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd
                        http://www.citrusframework.org/schema/testcase http://www.citrusframework.org/schema/testcase/citrus-testcase.xsd">

    <testcase name="MyFirstTest">
      <description>
          First example showing the basic test case definition elements!
      </description>
      <variables>
        <variable name="text" value="Hello Test Framework"/>
      </variables>
      <actions>
        <echo>
          <message>${text}</message>
        </echo>
      </actions>
    </testcase>
</spring:beans>
----

The definition uses the `&lt;spring:beans&gt;` root element that declares all XML namespaces used in the file. This is because
the XML file will be loaded as a Spring framework bean definition file. The root element defines a `testcase` element
which represents the actual Citrus test.

The test case itself gets a mandatory name that must be unique throughout all test cases in a project. You will receive
errors when using duplicate test names. The test name has to follow the common Java naming conventions and rules for Java
classes. This means names must not contain whitespace characters except `'-'`, `'.'` and `'_'`.

For example, *_TestFeature_1_* is valid but *_Test Feature 1_* is not because of the space characters.

[[xml-test-meta-info]]
== Test meta information

The user is able to provide some additional information about the test case. The meta-info section at the very beginning of the
test case holds information like author, status or creation date.

.XML DSL
[source,xml]
----
<testcase name="metaInfoTest">
    <meta-info>
        <author>Christoph Deppisch</author>
        <creationdate>2008-01-11</creationdate>
        <status>FINAL</status>
        <last-updated-by>Christoph Deppisch</last-updated-by>
        <last-updated-on>2008-01-11T10:00:00</last-updated-on>
    </meta-info>
    <description>
        ...
    </description>
    <actions>
        ...
    </actions>
</testcase>
----

.Test meta information
[source,java]
----
@CitrusTest
public void sampleTest() {
    description("This is a Test");
    author("Christoph");
    status(Status.FINAL);

    run(echo("Hello Citrus!"));
}
----

The status allows the following values:

* DRAFT
* READY_FOR_REVIEW
* DISABLED
* FINAL

This information gives the reader first impression about the test and is also used to generate test documentation. By default,
Citrus is able to generate test reports in HTML and Excel in order to list all tests with their metadata information and description.

NOTE: Tests with the status DISABLED will not be executed during a test suite run. So someone can just start adding planned
test cases that are not finished yet in status DRAFT. In case a test is not runnable yet because it is not finished, someone
may disable a test temporarily to avoid causing failures during a test run.

The test description should give a short introduction to the intended use case scenario that will be tested. The user should get
a short summary of what the test case is trying to verify. You can use free text in your test description no limit to
the number of characters. Please be aware of the XML validation rules of well-formed XML (e.g. special character escaping).
The usage of CDATA sections for large descriptions may be a good idea, too.

[[xml-test-finally]]
== Finally block

Java developers might be familiar with the concept of try-catch-finally blocks. The *_finally_* section contains a list of
test actions that will be executed guaranteed at the very end of the test case even if errors did occur during the execution before.

This is the right place to tidy up things that were previously created by the test like cleaning up the database for instance.

.Finally block
[source,xml]
----
<finally>
    <echo>
        <message>Do finally - regardless of what has happened before</message>
    </echo>
</finally>
----

As an example imagine that you have prepared some data inside the database at the beginning of the test and you need to make
sure the data is cleaned up at the end of the test case.

.Finally block example
[source,xml]
----
<testcase name="finallyTest">
    <variables>
        <variable name="orderId" value="citrus:randomNumber(5)"/>
        <variable name="date" value="citrus:currentDate('dd.MM.yyyy')"/>
    </variables>
    <actions>
        <sql datasource="testDataSource">
            <statement>
                INSERT INTO ORDERS VALUES (${orderId}, 1, 1, '${date}')
            </statement>
        </sql>

        <echo>
            <message>
                ORDER creation time: ${date}
            </message>
        </echo>
    </actions>
    <finally>
        <sql datasource="testDataSource">
            <statement>
              DELETE FROM ORDERS WHERE ORDER_ID='${orderId}'
            </statement>
        </sql>
    </finally>
</testcase>
----

In the example the first action creates an entry in the database using an *_INSERT_* statement. To be sure that the entry
in the database is deleted after the test, the finally section contains the respective *_DELETE_* statement that is always
executed regardless the test case state (successful or failed).

[[xml-test-variables-cdata]]
== Variables with CDATA sections

When using the XML test definition you must obey the XML rules for variable values. First of all you need to escape XML
reserved characters such as `<`, `&` or `"` with `&lt;`, `&amp;` or `&quot;`. Other values such as XML snippets would
also interfere with the XML well-formed paradigm. You can use CDATA sections within the variable value element as a solution.

.Variable CDATA sections
[source,xml]
----
<variables>
  <variable name="persons">
    <value>
      <data>
        <![CDATA[
          <persons>
            <person>
              <name>Theodor</name>
              <age>10</age>
            </person>
            <person>
              <name>Alvin</name>
              <age>9</age>
            </person>
          </persons>
        ]]>
      </data>
    </value>
  </variable>
</variables>
----

That is how you can use structured variable values in the XML DSL.

[[xml-variables-groovy]]
== Variables with Groovy

You can also use a script to create variable values. This is extremely handy when you have very complex variable values.
Just code a small Groovy script for instance in order to define the variable value. A small sample should give you the
idea how that works:

.Groovy variable script
[source,xml]
----
<variables>
  <variable name="avg">
    <value>
      <script type="groovy">
        <![CDATA[
          a = 4
          b = 6
          return (a + b) / 2
        ]]>
      </script>
    </value>
  </variable>
  <variable name="sum">
    <value>
      <script type="groovy">
        <![CDATA[
          5 + 5
        ]]>
      </script>
    </value>
  </variable>
</variables>
----

Just use the script code right inside the variable value definition. The value of the variable is the result of the last
operation performed within the script. For longer script code the use of `&lt;![CDATA[ ]]&gt;` sections is recommended.

Citrus uses the Java script engine mechanism to evaluate the script code. By default, Groovy is supported as a script
engine implementation. You can add additional engine implementations to your project and support other script types, too.

[[xml-templates]]
== Templates

Templates group action sequences to a logical unit. You can think of templates as reusable components that are used in several
XML tests. The maintenance is much more efficient because you need to apply changes only on the templates and all referenced
use cases are updated automatically.

The template always has a unique name. Inside a test case we call the template by this unique name. Have a look at a first example:

.XML templates
[source,xml]
----
<template name="doCreateVariables">
    <create-variables>
        <variable name="var" value="123456789"/>
    </create-variables>

    <call-template name="doTraceVariables"/>
</template>

<template name="doTraceVariables">
    <echo>
        <message>Current time is: ${time}</message>
    </echo>

    <trace-variables/>
</template>
----

The code example above describes two template definitions. Templates hold a sequence of test actions or call other templates
themselves as seen in the example above.

NOTE: The `<call-template>` action calls other templates by their name. The called template not necessarily has to be located
in the same test case XML file. The template might be defined in a separate XML file other than the test case itself:

.Call XML templates
[source,xml]
----
<testcase name="templateTest">
    <variables>
        <variable name="myTime" value="citrus:currentDate()"/>
    </variables>
    <actions>
        <call-template name="doCreateVariables"/>

        <call-template name="doTraceVariables">
            <parameter name="time" value="${myTime}">
        </call-template>
    </actions>
</testcase>
----

There is an open question when dealing with templates that are defined somewhere else outside the test case. How to handle
variables? A templates may use different variable names then the test and vice versa. No doubt the template will fail as
soon as special variables with respective values are not present. Unknown variables cause the template and the whole test
to fail with errors.

So a first approach would be to harmonize variable usage across templates and test cases, so that templates and test cases
do use the same variable naming. But this approach might lead to high calibration effort. Therefore templates support parameters
to solve this problem. When a template is called the calling actor is able to set some parameters. Let us discuss an example
for this issue.

The template "doDateConversion" in the next sample uses the variable ${date}. The calling test case can set this variable
as a parameter without actually declaring the variable in the test itself:

.Template parameter
[source,xml]
----
<call-template name="doDateConversion">
    <parameter name="date" value="${sampleDate}">
</call-template>
----

The variable *sampleDate* is already present in the test case and gets translated into the *date* parameter. Following from
that the template works fine although test and template do work on different variable namings.

With template parameters you are able to solve the calibration effort when working with templates and variables. It is
always a good idea to check the used variables/parameters inside a template when calling it. There might be a variable that
is not declared yet inside your test. So you need to define this value as a parameter.

Template parameters may contain more complex values like XML fragments. The call-template action offers following CDATA
variation for defining complex parameter values:

.Complex parameter values
[source,xml]
----
<call-template name="printXMLPayload">
    <parameter name="payload">
      <value>
        <![CDATA[
          <HelloRequest xmlns="http://www.consol.de/schemas/samples/sayHello.xsd">
            <Text>Hello South ${var}</Text>
          </HelloRequest>
        ]]>
      </value>
    </parameter>
</call-template>
----

IMPORTANT: When a template works on variable values and parameters changes to these variables will automatically affect the
variables in the whole test. So if you change a variable's value inside a template and the variable is defined inside the
test case the changes will affect the variable in a global context. We have to be careful with this when executing a template
several times in a test, especially in combination with parallel containers (see link:#containers-parallel[containers-parallel]).

.Global scope parameter
[source,xml]
----
<parallel>
    <call-template name="print">
        <parameter name="param1" value="1"/>
        <parameter name="param2" value="Hello Europe"/>
    </call-template>
    <call-template name="print">
        <parameter name="param1" value="2"/>
        <parameter name="param2" value="Hello Asia"/>
    </call-template>
    <call-template name="print">
        <parameter name="param1" value="3"/>
        <parameter name="param2" value="Hello Africa"/>
    </call-template>
</parallel>
----

In the listing above a template *print* is called several times in a parallel container. The parameter values will be handled
in a global context, so it is quite likely to happen that the template instances influence each other during execution. We
might get such print messages:

.Output
[source,xml]
----
2. Hello Europe
2. Hello Africa
3. Hello Africa
----

Index parameters do not fit and the message *'Hello Asia'* is completely gone. This is because templates overwrite parameters
to each other as they are executed in parallel at the same time. To avoid this behavior we need to tell the template that
it should handle parameters as well as variables in a local context. This will enforce that each template instance is working
on a dedicated local context. See the *global-context* attribute that is set to *false* in this example:

.Local scope parameter
[source,xml]
----
<template name="print" global-context="false">
    <echo>
        <message>${param1}.${param2}</message>
    </echo>
</template>
----

After that template instances won't influence each other anymore. But notice that variable changes inside the template then
do not affect the test case neither.
