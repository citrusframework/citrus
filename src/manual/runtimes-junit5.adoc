[[runtime-junit5]]
== JUnit5

With JUnit version 5 the famous unit test framework offers a new major version. The JUnit platform provides awesome extension
points for other frameworks like Citrus to integrate with the unit testing execution.

Citrus provides extensions in order to enable Citrus related dependency injection and parameter resolving in your JUnit5 test.

NOTE: The JUnit5 support is shipped in a separate Maven module. You need to include the module as a dependency in your
project.

.JUnit5 module dependency
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.citrusframework</groupId>
  <artifactId>citrus-junit5</artifactId>
  <version>${citrus.version}</version>
</dependency>

[[junit5-citrus-support]]
=== Citrus extension

You can use the Citrus JUnit5 extension on your test as follows:

.JUnit5 Citrus test
[source,java]
----
package org.citrusframework.samples;

import org.citrusframework.GherkinTestActionRunner;
import org.citrusframework.annotations.CitrusTest;
import org.citrusframework.junit.jupiter.CitrusSupport;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;

@CitrusSupport
public class Simple_IT {

    @Test
    @CitrusTest(name = "Simple_IT")
    public void simpleTest(@CitrusResource GherkinTestActionRunner runner) {
        runner.description("First example showing the basic Java DSL!");

        runner.given(
            variable("user", "Citrus")
        );

        runner.then(
            echo().message("Hello ${user}!"
        ));
    }
}
----

The class above is using the JUnit5 `@Test` annotation as a normal unit test would do. The `@CitrusSupport` annotation marks
the test to use the Citrus JUnit5 extension. This enables us to use the `@CitrusTest` annotation on the test and adds
support for the parameter injection for the `TestActionRunner`.

TIP: You can use the `@CitrusSupport` annotation, or you can use the classic `@ExtendWith(CitrusExtension.class)` annotation
to enable the Citrus support for JUnit5.

The Citrus Java DSL runner is the entrance to the Java fluent API provided by Citrus. The sample above uses the Gherkin test runner
variation for leveraging the BDD (Behavior Driven Development) style Given-When-Then syntax.

You can also inject the current `TestContext` in order to get access to the current test variables used by Citrus.

NOTE: You can also combine Citrus with the Spring framework and its dependency injection and IoC capabilities. In order to
enable Spring support in Citrus add the `citrus-spring` module to your project and use the `@ExtendWith(CitrusSpringExtension.class)`
annotation. With the Spring support in Citrus the test is able to load components via the Spring application context.

[[junit5-endpoint-injection]]
=== Endpoint injection

In addition to injecting test resources you can also inject endpoints via `@CitrusEndpoint` annotated field injection in
your test class. This enables you to inject endpoint components that are defined in the Citrus context configuration.

.JUnit5 Citrus endpoint injection
[source,java]
----
package org.citrusframework.samples;

import org.citrusframework.annotations.*;
import org.citrusframework.GherkinTestActionRunner;
import org.citrusframework.junit.jupiter.CitrusSupport;
import org.citrusframework.http.client.HttpClient;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import org.springframework.http.HttpStatus;

@CitrusSupport
public class Simple_IT {

    @CitrusEndpoint
    private HttpClient httpClient;

    @Test
    @CitrusTest
    public void test(@CitrusResource GherkinTestActionRunner runner) {
        runner.http().client(httpClient)
                    .send()
                    .get("/hello");

        runner.http().client(httpClient)
                    .receive()
                    .response(HttpStatus.OK);
    }
}
----

[[junit5-citrus-spring-support]]
=== Citrus Spring extension

Spring is a famous dependency injection framework that also provides support for JUnit5. Citrus is able to load its
components as Spring beans in an application context. The Citrus JUnit5 extension works great with the Spring extension.

The Spring extension loads the application context and Citrus adds all components to the Spring bean configuration.

.JUnit5 Citrus Spring test
[source, java]
----
@CitrusSpringSupport
@ContextConfiguration(classes = CitrusSpringConfig.class)
public class SpringBean_IT {

    @Autowired
    private DirectEndpoint direct;

    @Test
    @CitrusTest
    void springBeanTest(@CitrusResource TestActionRunner actions) {
        actions.$(send().endpoint(direct)
                    .message()
                    .body("Hello from Citrus!"));

        actions.$(receive().endpoint(direct)
                    .message()
                    .body("Hello from Citrus!"));
    }
}
----

The test now uses the `@CitrusSpringSupport` annotation which combines the `@ExtendWith(CitrusSpringExtension.class)`
and `@ExtendWith(SpringExtension.class)` annotation. This way the test combines the Spring application context management with
the Citrus Java DSL functionality.

You can load Spring beans with `@Autowired` into your test. Also you can use the `@CitrusResource` annotations to inject
the test action runner fluent Java API.

TIP: The Spring application context should use the basic `CitrusSpringConfig` configuration class to load all Citrus
components as Spring beans. You can customize the Spring application context by adding more configuration classes.
