[[plaintext-message-validation]]
== Plain text validation

Plain text message validation performs an exact Java String match of received and expected message payloads.

Plaintext message validation is not enabled by default in your project. You need to add the validation module to your project
as a Maven dependency.

.Plaintext validation module dependency
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.citrusframework.citrus</groupId>
  <artifactId>citrus-validation-text</artifactId>
  <version>${citrus.version}</version>
</dependency>
----

This adds the default message validator for plaintext messages. Citrus will pick this message validator for all messages
of *type="plaintext"*. The default message validator implementation can be overwritten by placing a Spring bean with
id *defaultPlaintextMessageValidator*.

.Java
[source,java,indent=0,role="primary"]
----
@Bean
public PlainTextMessageValidator defaultPlaintextMessageValidator() {
    return new PlainTextMessageValidator();
}
----

.XML
[source,xml,indent=0,role="secondary"]
----
<bean id="defaultPlaintextMessageValidator" class="org.citrusframework.citrus.validation.text.PlainTextMessageValidator"/>
----

Citrus will try to auto-guess the appropiate message validator for the incoming message. You can explicitly set the message
type on the receive action so Citrus knows how to apply plaintext message validation.

.Java
[source,java,indent=0,role="primary"]
----
receive("someEndpoint")
    .message()
    .type(MessageType.PLAINTEXT)
    .body("Hello World!");
----

.XML
[source,xml,indent=0,role="secondary"]
----
<receive endpoint="someEndpoint">
    <message type="plaintext">
        <data>Hello World!</data>
    </message>
</receive>
----

With the message format type *type="plaintext"* set Citrus performs String equals on the message payloads (received and expected).
Only exact match will pass the test.

Of course test variables are supported in the plaintext payloads. The variables are replaced before processing the message
template.

.Java
[source,java,indent=0,role="primary"]
----
receive("someEndpoint")
    .message()
    .type(MessageType.PLAINTEXT)
    .body("${hello} ${world}!");
----

.XML
[source,xml,indent=0,role="secondary"]
----
<receive endpoint="someEndpoint">
    <message type="plaintext">
        <data>${hello} ${world}!</data>
    </message>
</receive>
----

[[plaintext-validation-whitespaces]]
=== Whitespace characters

Plaintext message payloads may only differ in system-dependent line separator characters (*CR*, _LF_, _CRLF_). By default,
the plaintext message validation fails because of that differences even if only whitespace characters are different.

You can disable this default validation behavior and ignore new line types with following system property or environment variable:

.Plaintext validation settings
[source,properties]
----
citrus.plaintext.validation.ignore.newline.type=true
CITRUS_PLAINTEXT_VALIDATION_IGNORE_NEWLINE_TYPE=true
----

In case you need to ignore all whitespaces during plaintext validation such as multiple new line characters or tabs you
need to set this system property or environment variable:

.Plaintext validation settings
[source,properties]
----
citrus.plaintext.validation.ignore.whitespace=true
CITRUS_PLAINTEXT_VALIDATION_IGNORE_WHITESPACE=true
----

This property will not only ignore new line types but also normalize the whitespaces. As a result all empty lines, tabs
and double whitespace characters are filtered before comparison.

Of course, you can also set the properties directly on the plaintext message validator bean:

.Java
[source,java,indent=0,role="primary"]
----
@Bean
public PlainTextMessageValidator defaultPlaintextMessageValidator() {
    PlainTextMessageValidator validatoe = new PlainTextMessageValidator();
    validator.setIgnoreNewLineType(true);
    validator.setIgnoreWhitespace(true);
    return validator;
}
----

.XML
[source,xml,indent=0,role="secondary"]
----
<bean id="defaultPlaintextMessageValidator" class="org.citrusframework.citrus.validation.text.PlainTextMessageValidator">
  <property name="ignoreNewLineType" value="true"/>
  <property name="ignoreWhitespace" value="true"/>
</bean>
----

[[plaintext-validation-ignore]]
=== Ignoring text parts

The plaintext validator performs a String equals operation. Test variables are automatically replaced before that comparison
takes place but what about ignore statements? The plaintext message validator is able to ignore words and character sequences
based on their position in the text value. Given a source plaintext value:

.Received text
[source,text]
----
Your current id is "1234567890"
----

In the plaintext validation you need to ignore the actual id value due to some reason. Maybe the id is generated on a foreign
application and you simply do not know the actual value at runtime.

In this case we can use the common `@ignore@` statement in the control message payload as follows:

.Control text
[source,text]
----
Your current id is "@ignore@"
----

Citrus and the plaintext message validator will ignore the marked part of the text during validation. This mechanism is
based on the fact that the `@ignore@` statement is placed at the exact same position as the actual id value. So this mechanism
requires you to know the exact structure of the plaintext value including all whitespace characters. In case Citrus finds the `@ignore@`
keyword in the control value the placeholder is replaced with the actual character sequence that is located at the exact
same position in the source message payload that is validated.

The character sequence is defined as sequence of Java word characters. This word sequence is ending with a non-word character
defined in Java (`\\W` which is a character that is not in `[a-zA-Z_0-9]`).

Instead of ignoring a single word you can also specify the amount of characters that should be ignored. This is when you
have Java non-word characters that you need to ignore. Let's have an example for that, too:

.Received text
[source,text]
----
Your current id is "#12345-67890"
----

Given that text the simple `@ignore@` statement will fail because of the non-word characters *'#'* and *'-'* that are located
in the id value. This time we ignore the whole id sequence with:

.Control text
[source,text]
----
Your current id is "@ignore(12)@"
----

This will ignore exactly *12* characters starting from the exact position of the `@ignore@` keyword. So knowing that the
id is exactly *12* characters long we can ignore that part.

[[plaintext-validation-variables]]
=== Creating variables

Instead of just ignoring certain text parts we can also extract those parts into test variables. The actual character sequence
is ignored during validation and in addition to that the actual value is stored to a new test variable. Given the following text payload:

.Received text
[source,text]
----
Your current id is "1234567890"
----

And the expected control text:

.Control text
[source,text]
----
Your current id is "@variable('id')@"
----

The validation will automatically ignore the id part in the text and create a new test variable with name `id` that holds
the actual value. The name of the variable to create is given in the `@variable()@` statement. This enables us to extract
dynamic text parts that we are not able to validate. After that we can access the dynamic text part using the normal test
variable syntax `${id}`.

Also notice that the `@variable()@` keyword expression has to be placed at the exact same position in the text as the actual
value. The variable extractor will read the variable value from the source message payload starting from that position.
The ending of the variable value is defined by a non-word Java character. Dashes *'-'* and dots *'.'* are automatically
included in these values, too. So this will also work for you:

.Received text
[source,text]
----
Today is "2017-12-24"
----

And the expected control text:

.Control text
[source,text]
----
Today is "@variable('date')@"
----

This results in a new variable called `date` with value `2017-12-24`. In addition, the European date representation works fine
here, too because dots and dashes are automatically included:

.Received text
[source,text]
----
Today is "24.12.2017"
----

[[plaintext-validation-gzip]]
=== Gzip validation

Gzip is a message compression library to optimize the message transport of large content. Citrus is able to handle
compressed message payloads on send and receive operations. Sending compressed data sets the message type to *gzip*.

.Java
[source,java,indent=0,role="primary"]
----
send("someEndpoint")
    .message()
    .type(MessageType.GZIP)
    .body("Hello World!")
----

.XML
[source,xml,indent=0,role="secondary"]
----
<send endpoint="someEndpoint">
    <message type="gzip">
        <data>Hello World!</data>
    </message>
</send>
----

Just use the *type="gzip"* message type in the send operation. Citrus now converts the message payload to a gzip binary
stream as payload.

When validating gzip binary message content the messages are compared with a given control message in binary base64 String
representation. The gzip binary data is automatically unzipped and encoded as base64 character sequence in order to compare
with an expected content.

The received message content is using gzip format but the actual message content does not have to be base64 encoded. Citrus
is doing this conversion automatically before validation takes place. The binary data can be anything e.g. images, pdf or
plaintext content.

The default message validator for gzip messages is active by default. Citrus will pick this message validator for all messages
of *type="gzip_base64"* . The default message validator implementation can be overwritten by placing a Spring bean with
id *defaultGzipBinaryBase64MessageValidator* to the Spring application context.

.Java
[source,java,indent=0,role="primary"]
----
@Bean
public GzipBinaryBase64MessageValidator defaultGzipBinaryBase64MessageValidator() {
    return new GzipBinaryBase64MessageValidator();
}
----

.XML
[source,xml,indent=0,role="secondary"]
----
<bean id="defaultGzipBinaryBase64MessageValidator"
      class="org.citrusframework.citrus.validation.text.GzipBinaryBase64MessageValidator"/>
----

In the test case receiving action we tell Citrus to use gzip message validation.

.Java
[source,java,indent=0,role="primary"]
----
receive("someEndpoint")
    .message()
    .type(MessageType.GZIP_BASE64)
    .body("citrus:encodeBase64('Hello World!')")
----

.XML
[source,xml,indent=0,role="secondary"]
----
<receive endpoint="someEndpoint">
    <message type="gzip_base64">
        <data>citrus:encodeBase64('Hello World!')</data>
    </message>
</receive>
----

With the message format type *type="gzip_base64"* Citrus performs the gzip base64 character sequence validation. Incoming
message content is automatically unzipped and encoded as base64 String and compared to the expected data. This way we can
make sure that the binary content is as expected.

NOTE: If you are using http client and server components the gzip compression support is built in with the underlying Spring
and http commons libraries. So in http communication you just have to set the header *Accept-Encoding=gzip* or *Content-Encoding=gzip*.
The message data is then automatically zipped/unzipped before Citrus gets the message data for validation. Read more about
this http specific gzip compression in link:#http-rest[chapter http].
