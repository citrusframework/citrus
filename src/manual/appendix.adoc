[[maven-archetypes]]
== Maven archetype

If you start from scratch or in case you would like to have Citrus operating in a separate Maven module you can use the
Citrus Maven archetype to create a new Maven project. The archetype will setup a basic Citrus project structure with basic
settings and files.

[source,xml]
----
mvn archetype:generate -Dfilter=org.citrusframework.citrus.mvn:citrus

1: remote -> org.citrusframework.citrus.mvn:citrus-quickstart (Citrus quickstart project)
2: remote -> org.citrusframework.citrus.mvn:citrus-quickstart-jms (Citrus quickstart project with JMS consumer and producer)
3: remote -> org.citrusframework.citrus.mvn:citrus-quickstart-soap (Citrus quickstart project with SOAP client and producer)
Choose a number: 1

Define value for groupId: org.citrusframework.citrus.samples
Define value for artifactId: citrus-sample
Define value for version: 1.0-SNAPSHOT
Define value for package: org.citrusframework.citrus.samples
----

In the sample above we used the Citrus archetype available in Maven central repository.
As the list of default archetypes available in Maven central is very long, it has been filtered for official Citrus archetypes.

After choosing the Citrus quickstart archetype you have to define several values for your project: the groupId, the artifactId,
the package and the project version. After that we are done! Maven created a Citrus project structure for us which is
ready for testing. You should see the following basic project folder structure.

[source,xml]
----
citrus-sample
  |   + src
  |   |   + main
  |   |    |   + java
  |   |    |   + resources
  |   |   + test
  |   |    |   + java
  |   |    |   + resources
  pom.xml
----

The Citrus project is absolutely ready for testing. With Maven we can build, package, install and test our project right
away without any adjustments. Try to execute the following commands:

[source,xml]
----
mvn clean verify
mvn clean verify -Dit.test=MyFirstCitrusTest
