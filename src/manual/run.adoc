= Run tests

You can write Citrus tests in various programming languages.
The following chapters describe the individual domain specific languages that support you in writing tests in Citrus.

NOTE: We do our best to make all features equal in all supported languages. Some feature may only make sense in a specific test project setup and are not applicable to all languages (e.g. test behaviors only run in Java classes).
