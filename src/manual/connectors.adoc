[[connectors]]
= Connectors

Connectors generally are quite similar to link:#endpoints[endpoints].
These modules connect Citrus to a certain technology or framework rather than implementing a message transport (client and server) like endpoints usually do.

Connectors typically provide a client side only implementation that enable Citrus to interact with a service or framework (e.g. Docker deamon, Selenium web driver, OpenAPI specification).
