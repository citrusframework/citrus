[[jms]]
= JMS support

Citrus provides support for sending and receiving JMS messages. We have to separate between synchronous and asynchronous
communication. So in this chapter we explain how to work with JMS message endpoints for synchronous and asynchronous communication

NOTE: The JMS components in Citrus are kept in a separate Maven module. If not already done so you have to include the module
as Maven dependency to your project

.Maven module dependency
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.citrusframework</groupId>
  <artifactId>citrus-jms</artifactId>
  <version>${citrus.version}</version>
</dependency>
----

Citrus provides a "citrus-jms" configuration namespace and schema definition for JMS related components and features. Include
this namespace into your Spring configuration in order to use the Citrus JMS configuration elements. The namespace URI and
schema location are added to the Spring configuration XML file as follows.

.Spring configuration namespace
[source,xml]
----
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
       xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
       xmlns:citrus-jms="http://www.citrusframework.org/schema/jms/config"
       xsi:schemaLocation="

       http://www.citrusframework.org/schema/jms/config/citrus-jms-config.xsd">

    [...]

</beans>
----

Now you are able to use customized Citrus XML elements in order to define the JMS endpoint components.

[[jms-endpoints]]
== JMS endpoints

By default, Citrus JMS endpoints are asynchronous. Asynchronous messaging means that the endpoint will not wait for a response
message after sending a message.

The test case itself should not know about JMS transport details like queue names or connection credentials. This information
is stored in the endpoint component configuration that lives in the basic project configuration files in Citrus. So let us
have a look at a simple JMS message endpoint configuration in Citrus.

.Java
[source,java,indent=0,role="primary"]
----
@Bean
public JmsEndpoint helloServiceEndpoint() {
    return new JmsEndpointBuilder()
        .destination("Citrus.HelloService.Request.Queue")
        .timeout(10000L)
        .build();
}
----

.XML
[source,xml,indent=0,role="secondary"]
----
<citrus-jms:endpoint id="helloServiceEndpoint"
          destination-name="Citrus.HelloService.Request.Queue"
          timeout="10000"/>
----

The endpoint component receives a unique id as well as a JMS destination name. This can be a queue or topic destination.
JMS topics are described later on in this chapter. For now the timeout setting completes the first JMS endpoint component
definition example.

NOTE: In addition to the `destination-name` attribute you can also provide a reference to a destination implementation.

.Java
[source,java,indent=0,role="primary"]
----
@Bean
public JmsEndpoint helloServiceEndpoint() {
    return new JmsEndpointBuilder()
        .destination(helloServiceQueue())
        .build();
}

@Bean
public ActiveMQQueue helloServiceQueue() {
    return new ActiveMQQueue("Citrus.HelloService.Request.Queue");
}
----

.XML
[source,xml,indent=0,role="secondary"]
----
<citrus-jms:endpoint id="helloServiceEndpoint"
                     destination="helloServiceQueue"/>

<amq:queue id="helloServiceQueue" physicalName="Citrus.HelloService.Request.Queue"/>
----

The destination attribute references to a JMS destination object in the same Spring application context. In the example
above we used the ActiveMQ queue destination component. The destination reference can also refer to a JNDI lookup for instance.

The endpoint needs a JMS connection factory for connecting to a JMS message broker. The connection factory is also added
as component bean to the Citrus project (e.g. in the Spring application context).

.Java
[source,java,indent=0,role="primary"]
----
@Bean
public ActiveMQConnectionFactory connectionFactory() {
    ActiveMQConnectionFactory factory = new ActiveMQConnectionFactory();
    factory.setBrokerURL("tcp://localhost:61616");
    return factory;
}
----

.XML
[source,xml,indent=0,role="secondary"]
----
<bean id="connectionFactory" class="org.apache.activemq.artemis.jms.client.ActiveMQConnectionFactory">
  <property name="brokerURL" value="tcp://localhost:61616"/>
</bean>
----

The JMS connection factory receives the broker URL and is able to hold many other connection specific options. In this example
we use the Apache ActiveMQ connection factory implementation as we want to use the ActiveMQ message broker. Citrus works
with a bean id *connectionFactory*. All Citrus JMS component will automatically recognize this connection factory.

TIP: The configuration makes it very easy to connect to other JMS broker implementations, too (e.g. Apache ActiveMQ, TIBCO Enterprise
Messaging Service, IBM Websphere MQ). Just add the required connection factory implementation as *connectionFactory* bean.

NOTE: All JMS endpoint components in Citrus will automatically load the factory named *connectionFactory*.
You can use the *connection-factory* endpoint attribute in order to use another connection factory instance with different
bean names.

.Java
[source,java,indent=0,role="primary"]
----
@Bean
public JmsEndpoint helloServiceEndpoint() {
    return new JmsEndpointBuilder()
        .destination("Citrus.HelloService.Request.Queue")
        .connectionFactory("myConnectionFactory")
        .build();
}
----

.XML
[source,xml,indent=0,role="secondary"]
----
<citrus-jms:endpoint id="helloServiceEndpoint"
      destination-name="Citrus.HelloService.Request.Queue"
      connection-factory="myConnectionFactory"/>
----

As an alternative to that you may want to use a special Spring jms template implementation as custom bean in your endpoint.

.Java
[source,java,indent=0,role="primary"]
----
@Bean
public JmsEndpoint helloServiceEndpoint() {
    return new JmsEndpointBuilder()
        .destination("Citrus.HelloService.Request.Queue")
        .jmsTemplate("myJmsTemplate")
        .build();
}
----

.XML
[source,xml,indent=0,role="secondary"]
----
<citrus-jms:endpoint id="helloServiceEndpoint"
              destination-name="Citrus.HelloService.Request.Queue"
              jms-template="myJmsTemplate"/>
----

The endpoint is now ready to be used inside a test case. You can send or receive messages using this endpoint. The test
actions reference the JMS endpoint using its unique identifier. When sending a message the message endpoint creates a JMS
message producer and will simply publish the message to the defined JMS destination. As the communication is asynchronous
by default the producer does not wait for a synchronous response.

When receiving messages the endpoint creates a JMS consumer on the JMS destination. The endpoint then acts as a message
driven listener. This means that the message consumer connects to the given destination and waits for messages to arrive.

.Java
[source,java,indent=0,role="primary"]
----
when(send("helloServiceEndpoint")
        .message()
        .body("..."));

then(receive("helloServiceEndpoint")
        .message()
        .body("..."));
----

.XML
[source,xml,indent=0,role="secondary"]
----
<testcase name="jmsMessagingTest">
    <actions>
        <send endpoint="helloServiceEndpoint">
            <message>

                </data>
            </message>
        </receive>
    </actions>
</testcase>

[[jms-synchronous-endpoints]]
== JMS synchronous endpoints

When using synchronous message endpoints Citrus will manage a reply destination for receiving a synchronous response message
on the reply destination. The following figure illustrates that we now have two destinations in our communication scenario.

image:figure_006.jpg[figure_006.jpg]

The synchronous message endpoint component is similar to the asynchronous variant that has been discussed before. The only
difference is that the endpoint will automatically manage a reply destination behind the scenes. By default, Citrus uses
temporary reply destinations that get automatically deleted after the communication handshake is done. Again we need to use
a JMS connection factory in the configuration as the component needs to connect to a JMS message broker.

.Java
[source,java,indent=0,role="primary"]
----
@Bean
public JmsSyncEndpoint helloServiceSyncEndpoint() {
    return new JmsEndpointBuilder()
        .destination("Citrus.HelloService.InOut.Queue")
        .build();
}
----

.XML
[source,xml,indent=0,role="secondary"]
----
<citrus-jms:sync-endpoint id="helloServiceSyncEndpoint"
          destination-name="Citrus.HelloService.InOut.Queue"
          timeout="10000"/>
----

The synchronous component defines a target destination which again is either a queue or topic destination. The endpoint will
create the temporary reply destinations on its own. As soon as the endpoint has published a request message it waits synchronously for the
response message to arrive at the reply destination. You can receive this reply message in your test case by referencing
this same endpoint in a receiving test action. The timeout setting defines how long the endpoint waits for the synchronous reply.
In case no reply message arrives in time a message timeout error is raised respectively.

See the following example test case which references the synchronous message endpoint in its send and receive test action
in order to send out a message and wait for the synchronous response.

.Java
[source,java,indent=0,role="primary"]
----
when(send("helloServiceSyncEndpoint")
        .message()
        .body("..."));

then(receive("helloServiceSyncEndpoint")
        .message()
        .body("..."));
----

.XML
[source,xml,indent=0,role="secondary"]
----
<testcase name="jmsSyncMessagingTest">
    <actions>
        <send endpoint="helloServiceSyncEndpoint">
            <message>
                <data>
                  [...]
                </data>
            </message>
        </send>

        <receive endpoint="helloServiceSyncEndpoint">
            <message>
                <data>
                  [...]
                </data>
            </message>
        </receive>
    </actions>
</testcase>
----

We initiated the synchronous communication by sending a message on the synchronous endpoint. The second step then receives
the synchronous message on the temporary reply destination that was automatically created for you.

If you rather want to define a static reply destination you can do so, too. The static reply destination is not deleted
after the communication handshake. You may need to work with message selectors then in order to pick the right response message
that belongs to a specific communication handshake. You can define a static reply destination on the synchronous endpoint
component as follows.

.Java
[source,java,indent=0,role="primary"]
----
@Bean
public JmsSyncEndpoint helloServiceSyncEndpoint() {
    return new JmsEndpointBuilder()
        .destination("Citrus.HelloService.InOut.Queue")
        .replyDestination("Citrus.HelloService.Reply.Queue")
        .build();
}
----

.XML
[source,xml,indent=0,role="secondary"]
----
<citrus-jms:sync-endpoint id="helloServiceSyncEndpoint"
          destination-name="Citrus.HelloService.InOut.Queue"
          reply-destination-name="Citrus.HelloService.Reply.Queue"
          timeout="10000"/>
----

Instead of using the *reply-destination-name* feel free to use the destination reference with *reply-destination* attribute.
Again you can use a JNDI lookup then to reference a destination object.

IMPORTANT: Be aware of permissions that are mandatory for creating temporary destinations. Citrus tries to create temporary
queues on the JMS message broker. Following from that the Citrus JMS user has to have the permission to do so. Be sure that
the user has the sufficient rights when using temporary reply destinations.

Up to now we have sent a message and waited for a synchronous response in the next step. Now it is also possible to switch
the directions of send and receive actions. Then we have the situation where Citrus receives a JMS message first and then
Citrus is in charge of providing a proper synchronous response message to the initial sender.

image:figure_007.jpg[figure_007.jpg]

In this scenario the foreign message producer has stored a dynamic JMS reply queue destination to the JMS header. So Citrus
has to send the reply message to this specific reply destination, which is dynamic of course. Fortunately the heavy lift
is done with the JMS endpoint and we do not have to change anything in our configuration. Again we just define a synchronous
message endpoint in the application context.

.Java
[source,java,indent=0,role="primary"]
----
@Bean
public JmsSyncEndpoint helloServiceSyncEndpoint() {
    return new JmsEndpointBuilder()
        .destination("Citrus.HelloService.InOut.Queue")
        .build();
}
----

.XML
[source,xml,indent=0,role="secondary"]
----
<citrus-jms:sync-endpoint id="helloServiceSyncEndpoint"
      destination-name="Citrus.HelloService.InOut.Queue"
      timeout="10000"/>
----

Now the only thing that changes here is that we first receive a message in our test case on this endpoint. The second step
is a send message action that references this same endpoint and we are done. Citrus automatically manages the reply destinations
for us.

.Java
[source,java,indent=0,role="primary"]
----
when(receive("helloServiceSyncEndpoint")
        .message()
        .body("..."));

then(send("helloServiceSyncEndpoint")
        .message()
        .body("..."));
----

.XML
[source,xml,indent=0,role="secondary"]
----
<testcase name="jmsSyncMessagingTest">
  <actions>
        <receive endpoint="helloServiceSyncEndpoint">
            <message>
                <data>
                  [...]
                </data>
            </message>
        </receive>

        <send endpoint="helloServiceSyncEndpoint">

            </message>
        </send>
    </actions>
</testcase>
----

[[jms-topics]]
== JMS topics

Up to now we have used JMS queue destinations on our endpoints. Citrus is also able to connect to JMS topic destinations.
In contrary to JMS queues which represents the *point-to-point* communication JMS topics use *publish-subscribe* mechanism
in order to spread messages over JMS.

A JMS topic producer publishes messages to the topic, while the topic accepts multiple message subscriptions and delivers
the message to all subscribers.

The Citrus JMS endpoints offer the attribute *'pub-sub-domain'*. Once this attribute is set to *true* Citrus will use JMS
topics instead of queue destinations.

NOTE: When using JMS topics in your project you may want to configure a `jakarta.jms.TopicConnectionFactory` instead of a
`jakarta.jms.QueueConnectionFactory`.

See the following example where the publish-subscribe attribute is set to true in JMS message endpoint components.

.Java
[source,java,indent=0,role="primary"]
----
@Bean
public JmsSyncEndpoint helloServiceSyncEndpoint() {
    return new JmsEndpointBuilder()
        .destination("Citrus.HelloService.Topic")
        .pubSubDomain(true)
        .build();
}
----

.XML
[source,xml,indent=0,role="secondary"]
<citrus-jms:endpoint id="helloServiceTopicEndpoint"
            destination="Citrus.HelloService.Topic"
            pub-sub-domain="true"/>
----

When using JMS topics you will be able to subscribe several test actions to the topic destination and receive a message
multiple times as all subscribers will receive the message. Also other applications besides Citrus are also able to consume
messages with a topic subscription. This allows Citrus and other software components to coexist in a test environment.

[[jms-topic-subscriber]]
=== JMS topic subscriber

By default, Citrus does not deal with durable subscribers when using JMS topics. This means that messages that were sent
in advance to the message subscription are not delivered to the Citrus message endpoint. Following from that racing conditions
may cause problems when using JMS topic endpoints in Citrus.

Be sure to start the Citrus subscription before messages are sent to the topic. Otherwise, you may lose some messages that
were sent in advance to the subscription. By default Citrus will use a subscription per receive action using the JMS endpoint
in the test cases. This means that the topic subscription is started and stopped per receive action when the action is performed
inside a test case.

In order to solve racing conditions for messages that are sent prior to the subscription you can also use a `auto-start`
setting on the JMS endpoint component. This causes Citrus to start/stop the subscription based on the endpoint lifecycle
instead of linking the subscription to the receive action. When the endpoint is ready the subscription is started and all
incoming message events are cached and stored to a internal in memory message channel for later consumption in the tests.

Here is the endpoint configuration with `auto-start` enabled.

.Java
[source,java,indent=0,role="primary"]
----
@Bean
public JmsSyncEndpoint helloServiceSyncEndpoint() {
    return new JmsEndpointBuilder()
        .destination("Citrus.HelloService.Topic")
        .pubSubDomain(true)
        .autoStart(true)
        .build();
}
----

.XML
[source,xml,indent=0,role="secondary"]
----
<citrus-jms:endpoint id="helloServiceTopicEndpoint"
            destination="helloServiceTopic"
            pub-sub-domain="true"
            auto-start="true"/>
----

NOTE: The `auto-start` option is only valid in combination with `pub-sub-domain` enabled. Other combinations may be ignored
or lead to configuration failure at start-up.

Now with `auto-start` set to `true` the Citrus JMS endpoint will setup a subscription at the very beginning when the endpoint
is loaded in the project. The internal message channel name is derived from the JMS endpoint id and follows the pattern:

`{citrus-jms:endpoint@id}":subscriber.inbound"`

The in memory channel id is the combined result of the JMS endpoint id and the prefix `:subscriber.inbound`. In our example
this would be `helloServiceTopicEndpoint:subscriber.inbound`. Now all messages sent to the topic in advance to the tests are
cached and ready for consumption and verification in the test.

In the test nothing really changes for you. You simply use a receive test action on the JMS endpoint as you would have done
before. In the background Citrus will automatically receive the messages from the in memory cache. This mechanism enables
us to not loose any messages that were sent to the topic in prior to Citrus firing up the test cases.

IMPORTANT: There is a small downside of the `auto-start` topic subscriber. As incoming events are cached internally you
will not be able to receive the same topic event in multiple receive actions within the Citrus project. If you need to receive
the topic message in several places within Citrus you need to set up several JMS topic endpoints with `auto-start` enabled.
In case you just have one receive action at a time you are good to go with the `auto-start` subscriber as it is described here.

[[jms-topic-durable-subscription]]
== JMS topic durable subscription

When using durable subscriptions on JMS message brokers the message events on a topic are preserved for a subscriber even
if the subscriber is inactive. This means that the subscriber may not loose any message events on that particular topic as
the subscription is durable and all events are stored for later consumption.

In case you want to activate durable subscriptions on the Citrus JMS endpoint use the `durable-subscription` setting in the
configuration:

.Java
[source,java,indent=0,role="primary"]
----
@Bean
public JmsSyncEndpoint helloServiceSyncEndpoint() {
    return new JmsEndpointBuilder()
        .destination("Citrus.HelloService.Topic")
        .pubSubDomain(true)
        .autoStart(true)
        .build();
}

@Bean SingleConnectionFactory topicConnectionFactory() {
    ActiveMQConnectionFactory factory = new ActiveMQConnectionFactory();
    factory.setBrokerURL("tcp://localhost:61616");
    factory.setClientID("citrusDurableConnectionFactory");
    factory.setWatchTopicAdvisories(false);

    return new SingleConnectionFactory(factory);
}
----

.XML

        </map>
      </constructor-arg>
      <property name="DefaultUser" value="citrus"/>
    </bean>
  </constructor-arg>
</bean>
----

The durable subscription in Citrus implies that the subscriber is started when the endpoint configuration is done. All
messages received on that subscription are cached internally until the receive action in the test case is performed for
actual message consumption. The `auto-start` setting is required to be enabled for this reason when using durable subscriptions.

By default, Citrus is using the JMS endpoint subscriber name as durable subscription name (e.g. *helloServiceTopicEndpoint:subscriber*).
You can overwrite the durable subscriber name with `durable-subscriber-name` setting on the endpoint.

In addition to that you need to add a client id on the connection factory so the message broker is able to identify the durable
subscription with the client address. Also we use the `SingleConnectionFactory` implementation of Spring as a connection factory
wrapper so we do not fail because of multiple connections with the same durable subscriber id.

[[jms-message-headers]]
== JMS message headers

The JMS specification defines a set of special message header entries that can go into your JMS message. These JMS headers
are stored differently in a JMS message header than other custom header entries do. This is why these special header values
should be set in a special syntax that we discuss in the next paragraphs.

.Java
[source,java,indent=0,role="primary"]
----
when(receive("helloServiceSyncEndpoint")
        .message()
        .header("citrus_jms_correlationId", "${correlationId}")
        .header("citrus_jms_messageId", "${messageId}")
        .header("citrus_jms_redelivered", "${redelivered}")
        .header("citrus_jms_timestamp", "${timestamp}")
        .body("..."));
----

.XML
[source,xml,indent=0,role="secondary"]
----
<header>
    <element name="citrus_jms_correlationId" value="${correlationId}"/>
    <element name="citrus_jms_messageId" value="${messageId}"/>
    <element name="citrus_jms_redelivered" value="${redelivered}"/>
    <element name="citrus_jms_timestamp" value="${timestamp}"/>
</header>
----

As you see all JMS specific message headers use the `citrus_jms_` prefix. This prefix comes from Spring Integration message
header mappers that take care of setting those headers in the JMS message header properly.

Typing of message header entries may also be of interest in order to meet the JMS standards of typed message headers. For
instance the following message header is of type double and is therefore transferred via JMS as a double value.

.Java
[source,java,indent=0,role="primary"]
----
when(receive("jmsEndpoint")
        .message()
        .header("amount", 19.75D)
        .body("..."));
----

.XML
[source,xml,indent=0,role="secondary"]
----
<header>
    <element name="amount" value="19.75" type="double"/>
</header>
----

[[dynamic-destination-names]]
== Dynamic destination names

Usually you set the target destination as property on the JMS endpoint component. In some cases it might be useful to set
the target destination in a more dynamic way during the test run. You can do this by adding a special message header named
*citrus_jms_destination_name*. This header is automatically interpreted by the Citrus JMS endpoint and is set as the target
destination before a message is sent.

.Java
[source,java,indent=0,role="primary"]
----
when(send("jmsEndpoint")
        .message()
        .header("citrus_jms_destination_name", "dynamic.destination.name")
        .body("..."));
----

.XML
[source,xml,indent=0,role="secondary"]
----
<send endpoint="jmsEndpoint">
    <message>
        ...
    </message>
    <header>
        <element name="citrus_jms_destination_name" value="dynamic.destination.name"/>
    </header>
</send>
----

This action above will send the message to the destination "_dynamic.destination.name_" no matter what default destination
is set on the referenced endpoint component named _jmsEndpoint_. The dynamic destination name setting also supports test
variables. This means you can use variables and functions in the destination name, too.

Another possibility for dynamic JMS destinations is given with the link:#dynamic-endpoint-components[dynamic endpoints].

[[soap-over-jms]]
== SOAP over JMS

When sending SOAP messages you have to deal with proper envelope, body and header construction. In Citrus you can add a
special message converter that performs the heavy lift for you. Just add the message converter to the JMS endpoint as shown
in the next program listing:

.Java
[source,java,indent=0,role="primary"]
----
@Bean
public JmsSyncEndpoint helloServiceSoapJmsEndpoint() {
    return new JmsEndpointBuilder()
        .destination("Citrus.HelloService.Request.Queue")
        .messageConverter(soapJmsMessageConverter())
        .build();

With this message converter you can skip the SOAP envelope completely in your test case. You just deal with the message
body payload and the header entries. The rest is done by the message converter. So you get proper SOAP messages on the
producer and consumer side.
