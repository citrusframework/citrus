= Introduction

Citrus provides automated integration tests for message-based enterprise applications. The framework is Open Source and
supports various messaging transports (Http REST, SOAP, JMS, Kafka, TCP/IP, FTP, ...) and data formats (XML, Json, plaintext, binary).

The Citrus tests use well-known unit test frameworks (JUnit, TestNG, Cucumber) for execution and integrates with build
tools like Maven or Gradle. In addition, Citrus leverages standard libraries like Spring Framework and Apache Camel.

[[overview]]
== Overview

Citrus supports simulating interface partners across different messaging transports. You can easily
produce and consume messages with a wide range of protocols like HTTP, JMS, TCP/IP, FTP, SMTP and more. The framework is able
to act both as a client and server. In each communication step Citrus is able to validate message contents towards syntax and semantics.

In addition to that the Citrus framework offers a wide range of test actions to take control of the process flow during a test
(e.g. iterations, system availability checks, database connectivity, parallelism, delays, error simulation, scripting and many more).

The test is able to describe a whole use case scenario including several interface partners that exchange many messages with each other.
The composition of complex message flows in a single test case with several test steps is one of the major features in Citrus.

You can choose how to describe the test case definition either with pure XML or a Java domain specific language. The tests can be
executed multiple times as automated integration test.

With JUnit and TestNG integration Citrus can easily be integrated into your build lifecycle process (Maven or Gradle). During a test Citrus
simulates all surrounding interface partners (client or server) without any coding effort. With easy definition of expected
message content (header and body) for XML, CSV, SOAP, JSON or plaintext messages Citrus is able to validate the incoming
data towards syntax and semantics.

[[usage-scenarios]]
== Usage scenarios

Citrus should help you whenever it comes to verify a message-based software with its interfaces to other components and partners
using automated integration tests. Every project that interacts with other components over messaging transports needs to simulate these
interface partners on the client or server side in a test scenario. Citrus is here to help you master these test automation tasks.

This test set up is typical for a Citrus use case. In such a test scenario we have a system under test (SUT) with several
messaging interfaces to other applications. A client application invokes services on the SUT and triggers business logic.
The SUT is linked to several backend applications over various messaging transports (here SOAP, JMS, and Http). As part of the
business logic one or more of these backend services is called and interim message notifications and responses are sent back to the
client application.

This generates a bunch of messages that are exchanged throughout the components involved.

In the automated integration test Citrus needs to send and receive those messages over different transports. Citrus takes
care of all interface partners (ClientApplication, Backend1, Backend2, Backend3) and simulates their behavior by sending
proper response messages in order to keep the message flow alive.

Each communication step comes with message validation and comparison against an expected message template (e.g. XML or JSON data).
In addition to messaging steps Citrus is also able to perform arbitrary other test actions (e.g. perform a database
query between requests).

In fact a Citrus test case is nothing but a normal JUnit or TestNG test case. This makes it very straight forward to run the tests from
your favorite Java IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ, VSCode, ...) and as part of your software build process (Maven or Gradle). The Citrus
tests become repeatable and give you fully automated integration tests to ensure software quality and interface stability.
